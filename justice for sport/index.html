            Sportspersons often face challenges in navigating the legal &
            Advisory landscape, with issues ranging from unfair fees to poor
            representation, this can be seen from several News reports such as
            the £1BN of bad advice report in the Guardian Newspaper. Our
            platform addresses these challenges by providing a centralised hub
            for sportspersons to rate their legal experiences and seek redress
            for grievances, we provide a window of information and a way to be
            heard for all sportspersons. <br />

            The market for legal services is vast, with sportspersons
            representing a significant segment of valued potential clients.
            However, many sportspersons struggle to find reliable information
            about lawyers and law firms, leading to subpar legal representation
            and unfair outcomes. <br /><br />
          </div>
          <div class="about-col">
            Our platform fills this gap by providing transparent and unbiased
            ratings based on real experiences. Our business revolves around the
            creation of a comprehensive lawyer and advisory rating platform
            tailored specifically to the needs of sportspersons, we look at your
            past and present cases, we then look at potential areas of GDPR
            breach, Malpractice, over billing and abuse of power by these firms
            and their representatives. This platform will allow sportspersons to
            rate firms based on various factors such as competency,
            professionalism, ethics, time, and fairness of fees. <br /><br />
            Additionally, we will offer support and representation to
            sportspersons who have experienced unfair treatment in the past. We
            will take action on lawyers, advisors and the firms who have worked
            with high-profile sportspersons and used their image and name to
            attract more clients to benefit their law firm.

          complaints. We listen to complaints about many different kinds of
          legal professionals registered in England or Wales and now expanding
          into other countries. Form information Please read the following
          information to make sure we best deal with your complaint. Please
          write as clearly as you can, as it will help us better understand your
          complaint. If you feel the poor service was given long ago don’t
          worry, we will still make the complaint heard with the court of public
          opinion. There is no need to send us any documents at this stage. When
          we ask you for documents, please only send copies. We will scan any
          documents you send us to make computer copies and then destroy the
          originals. So please make copies of any important papers relating to
          your complaint – such as letters, statements, messages, official
          documents or certificates and more. If we ask for any of these later,
          only send us copies. You should keep the originals yourself.
